# Gerry Yang Pianist Website

[Gerry Yang Pianist](https://gerry004.github.io/gerry-yang-pianist/) - live website hosted on Github Pages. 

Built with **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS** by Gerry Yang.

As a pianist, I performed on the Late Late Toy Show in 2014, I made my Carnegie Hall debut in 2017, and I've played for President Michael D Higgins at the Aras an Uachtarain. 

I've competed both nationally and internationally, winning the Biggs Cup at Feis Ceoil (Ireland's largest, national music comeptition) and the Treviso International Piano Competition.

On this site, you'll find a showcase of my achievements and successes as a pianist. You'll also find a custom audio player where you can explore my past performances. Hope you enjoy the site, thank you for visiting, and get in touch if you're looking to learn piano!
